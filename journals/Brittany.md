<!-- In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you'll need to include the following information in each entry: -->



<!-- The date of the entry
A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
A reflection on any design conversations that you had
At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small
Keep your journal in reverse chronological order. Always put new entries at the top. -->
