Today, I worked on:

* Worked as a team to create the repo. Everyone has access and it is up and running.
We made a game plan as to how we are going to start the project -copy backend from the practice repo
Ah-Ha!: Cloned it down~


<!-- In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you'll need to include the following information in each entry: -->



<!-- The date of the entry
A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
A reflection on any design conversations that you had
At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small
Keep your journal in reverse chronological order. Always put new entries at the top. -->
