Added Framer motion to our project and let me tell you it is super cool the pages animate so smoothly now and it jus t provides a better user experience overall. Probably the coolest thing i've seen besides understanding Redux better proud CSS moment for me.

Got the update and crate forms to work for our site had to add provider and invalidate tags for to each endpoint in our FridgeSlice and it made them refetch the data for each list before it re-rendered the page. Super happy we got that figured out it was giving me a headache.

Today we continued to work on the issue we had with the beverage detail page, trying to get
the correct identifier to pull data for our detail page. With the help of Murphey, Rob and Dalonte we finally figured out that the ma function that we were using map to pull details for a specific object which isn't the proper way to do it.

    Worked over the weekend to try to get our details page for beverages to work, keep getting a map error, asked for SEIR help to see if we could get it solved like a quick fix. Turns out it was a lot more than I anticipated, we ended up getting the Beverage list page to populate the items but the detail page is giving an map error. We ended the day with the same error. We are going to ask Dalonte for help help tomorrow afternoon if we can't solve it in the morning.

    Started building out the list and detail pages fro Beverages, so far things are going well, the functions are working well just going over the lectures from Riley to make sure that I under stand Redux better.

    So the pages won't dynamically refresh with vite i had to add polling to our vite.config file to make it work after about 2 hours of searching the internet i found a video on youtube that suggested the above and it works now!!! Super happy about that it was driving me crazy

Working on the the Nav and side bar of our page want to add something unique to our website that also has functionally. We are trying stick close to what our wire-frame looks like.

Watched Riley's front end auth lecture a couple of times, something is still not clicking all they way on why it wont work but it's making more sense than before.

Started adding the style to our frontend and have a couple of pages built out, it is looking better than i thought, Tailwind looks really cool if you know what your doing with it.

## Mar. 7 2024
I found a tailwind component library that i can use to help implement some of the feature i wan into our project with ease. Its called DaisyUi and it has many free prebuilt components that you can just use the code for and then edit them to your leisure but it def helps to have kind of a prebuilt guide to help you.

## Mar. 6 2024

I have started looking at different ways to implement tailwind into our project, and seeing if there are different component libraries and examples i can look at the help with my understanding of all the different things you can do with it. I will say that it is totally a different than bootstrap, in terms of the things you can do vs. how easy it is to do so. Tailwind will def take some learning

Our backend Auth works well now and we re just finishing adding locks to our important endpoints, again I will say that Brad and Trevor are really helping me get and understanding on the MongoDB and how it operates still not super confident with it but I understand at least what is going on for the most part.

## Mar. 4 2024

We switched our database to MongoDB from Postgres, it just wasn't agreeing with us and we just couldn't find the resources we needed to be confident with it, as we try to implement user authentication

things are working extremely well now

## Mar. 1 2024

Our group has hit a wall with our authenticator, can't figure out why exactly we can't retrieve the token for backend. Bradley has a better understanding on how Postgres works currently and even he is stuck, we are considering moving to Mongo but we want to try everything else first. Since the majority of our Database works including the endpoint just teh authenticator is giving use a hard time.

Today we made our repos excited to finally start the project, we decided that we are going to use POstgres as our database, since it seems  like a good thing to know in the future for employment. Nothing to crazy today just rewatching lectures and going over the learn and docs.
